#  Package Challenge

### Introduction

* You want to send your friend a package with different things.
* Each thing you put inside the package has such parameters as index number, weight and cost. The package has a weight limit. Your goal is to determine which things to put into the package so that the total weight is less than or equal to the package limit and the total cost is as large as possible.
You would prefer to send a package which weighs less in case there is more than one package with the same price.
Input sample

* Your API should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. The input file contains several lines. Each line is one test case.  
* Each line contains the weight that the package can take (before the colon) and the list of items you need to choose. Each item is enclosed in parentheses where the 1st number is a item’s index number, the 2nd is its weight and the 3rd is its cost.  
  E.g.  
  81 : (1,53.38,€45) (2,88.62,€98) (3,78.48,€3) (4,72.30,€76) (5,30.18,€9) (6,46.34,€48)  
  
  8 : (1,15.3,€34)   
  
  75 : (1,85.31,€29) (2,14.55,€74) (3,3.98,€16) (4,26.24,€55) (5,63.69,€52) (6,76.25,€75) (7,60.02,€74) (8,93.18,€35) (9,89.95,€78)  
  
  56 : (1,90.72,€13) (2,33.80,€40) (3,43.15,€10) (4,37.97,€16) (5,46.81,€36) (6,48.77,€79) (7,81.80,€45) (8,19.36,€79) (9,6.76,€64)  

### Output sample

* For each set of items that you put into a package provide a new row in the output string (items’ index numbers are separated by comma). E.g.  

  4  
  `-`   
 2,7  
 8,9  
 
 
### Requirement
* Java 11
